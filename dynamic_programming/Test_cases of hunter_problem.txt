test case 1(Overlapping arrays)

Input
A = [3,6,7,10,14,16,19,24,98,100,400]
B = [4,8,11,17,20,21,22,25,99,200,350]
C = [5,9,12,13,15,18,23,26,102,300,600]

Output
[21, 22, 25, 99, 200, 350, 100, 400, 98, 20, 23, 24, 26, 102, 300, 600]

test case 2 (Non overlapping arrays)

Input
A: [1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7, 8, 9, 10]
B: [11, 12, 13, 14, 15, 16, 17, 18, 19, 20]
C: [21, 22, 23, 24, 25, 26, 27, 28, 29, 30]

Output
[26, 27, 28, 29, 30, 23, 24, 25, 22, 16, 17, 18, 19, 20, 21]

Test case 3 (Medians are same)
A = [1,2,3,7,8,9,10]
B = [4,5,6,7,11,12,13]
C = [14,15,16,17,18,19,20]

Output
[17, 18, 19, 20, 15, 16, 14, 11, 12, 13]

Test Case 4 (Array are empty)
A = []
B = []
C = []

Output
[]

Test case 5(Random pick of 10 elements for each array from range 1 to 1000)
http://www.augustana.ca/~mohrj/algorithms/randpick.html

A = [239,246,290,390,512,629,689,833,906,952]
B = [14,44,65,183,303,689,792,869,872,985]
C = [157,187,285,312,323,358,456,634,718,891]

[689, 792, 869, 872, 985, 634, 718, 891, 952, 906, 456, 512, 629, 689, 833]

Test case 6(All elements are same)

A = [1,1,1,1,1]
B = [1,1,1,1,1]
C = [1,1,1,1,1]

[1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1]

Test case 7 (All negative inputs)
A = [-10,-8,-6,-4,-2]
B = [-9,-7,-5,-3,-1]
C = [-15,-14,-13,-12,-11]

Output
[-5, -3, -1, -2, -4, -7, -6]
